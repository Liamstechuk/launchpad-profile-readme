1. **What is a profile README?**: A _[profile README](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)_ is essentially an "About me" section on your GitHub profile where you can share information about yourself and your skills with the community on GitHub.com.

2. **Why create a profile README?**: Showcasing your skills in HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript can help others understand your expertise and interests. Plus, it's a great way to personalize your GitHub profile!

3. **Course tips**:
   - You've created a repository with a name that matches your GitHub username.
   - The repository is public.
   - The repository contains a file named README.md in its root.
   - The README.md file contains any content.
